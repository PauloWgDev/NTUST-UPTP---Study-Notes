# Asymetric Ciphers

Asymtric ciphers uses two keys, one public key and a private key, the public key is used for encryption and the private key is used for decryption.

P: plain text

C: cipher text

K<sub>private</sub>: private key

K<sub>public</sub>: public Key
</small>

C = encrypt(K<sub>public</sub>, P)

P = decrypt(K<sub>private</sub>, C)
