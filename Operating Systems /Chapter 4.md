## Benefits of multithreaded Programming
- Responsiveness: Multithreading an interactive application may allow a program to continue running even if part of tit is blocked or is performing a lengthy operation, thereby increasing responsiveness to the user.
- Resouce Sharing: Process can share resource only through techniques such as shared memory and message passing.
- Economy: Allocating memory and resources for process creation is constly. Because threads share the resource of the process to which they belong, it is more economical to create and context-switch threads.
- Scalability: the benefits of multithreading can be even greater in a multiprocessor architecture, whre threads may be running in parallel on different processing cores.
