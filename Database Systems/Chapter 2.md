# Data Models

## Data Modeling and Data Models

Data modeling refers to the process of creating a specific data model for a determined problem domain.
A data model is a relatively simple representation, usually graphical.

## The Importance of Data Models

Data models can facilitate interaction among the designer, the applications programmer, and the end user.

## Data Model Basic Building Blocks

- Entity: is a person,place thing, concept, or event about which data will be collected and stored.
- Attribute: is a characteristic of an entity.
- Relationship: describes an association among entities.
- Constrain: is a restriction placed on the data

#### Distictions among the three relationships

- One-to-many (1:M or 1..*) relationship
- Many-to-many (M:N or *...*) relationship
- One-to-one (1:1 or 1..1) relationship

### Business Rules
A business rule is a brief, precise, and unambiguous description of a policy, procedure, or principle within a specific organization.
Properly written business rules are used to define entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints.

**Examples of Buisness rules:**

- A customer may generate many invoices.
- An invoice is generated by only one customer.
- A training session cannot be scheduled for fewer than 10 employees or for more than 30 employees.

**Importance of Business rules:**
- It helps to standardize the company’s view of data.
- It can be a communication tool between users and designers.
- It allows the designer to understand the nature, role, and scope of the data.
- It allows the designer to understand business processes.
- It allows the designer to develop appropriate relationship participation rules and constraints and to create an accurate data model.

### Naming Conventions

Entity names should be descriptive of the objects in the business environment and use terminology that is familiar to the users. An attribute name should also be descriptive of the data represented by that attribute. It is also a good practice to prefix the name of an attribute with the name or abbreviation of the entity in which it occurs. For example, in the CUSTOMER entity, the customer’s credit limit may be called CUS_CREDIT_LIMIT

### The Relational Model

you can think of a relation (or table) as a two-dimensional componed of intersecting columns and rows. Each row in a relation is called a tuple. Each column represents an attribute.

### The Object-Oriented Model

In the object-oriented data model (OODM), both data 
and its relationships are contained in a single structure known as an object

An OODM reflects a very different way to define and use entities. Like the relational 
model’s entity, an object is described by its factual content. But, quite unlike an entity, an object 
includes information about relationships between the facts within the object, as well as information about its relationships with other objects. Therefore, the facts within the object are 
given greater meaning. The OODM is said to be a semantic data model because semantic
indicates meaning

### Degrees of Data Abstraction

- External Model: is the end user's view of the data enviroment
- Conceptual Model: represents the global view of the entire database by the entire organization
- Internal Model: representation of the database as seen by the DBMS.
- Physical model: operates of the lowes level of abstraction, describing the way data is saved on storage media.
