### Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a Flashcards app in Android Studio using RoomDB to manage flashcards, categories, and user progress.

### Key Features

1. **User Management:**
    
    - Profile creation and management.
    - Tracking user progress and statistics.
2. **Flashcard Management:**
    
    - CRUD operations for flashcards.
    - Organize flashcards into Groups.
    - Tagging for flashcards.
3. **Study Sessions:**
    - Start a study session with selected flashcards or categories.
    - Track correct and incorrect responses.
    - Provide feedback on performance.
4. **Statistics and Progress Tracking:**
    
    - Track study sessions, number of correct/incorrect responses.
    - Display progress over time.
5. **Search and Filter:**
    
    - Search flashcards by keywords, tags, categories.
    - Filter flashcards based on user performance (e.g., least known cards).
